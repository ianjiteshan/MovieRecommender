# ðŸŽ¥ Movie Recommender System
---
## Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommender System** that suggests the top 5 movies similar to a user-selected movie based on content similarity. The system uses **vectorization** techniques and **cosine similarity** to measure how closely related the movies are in terms of content (such as genres, descriptions, and keywords).

The project includes:
- A **Machine Learning model** that processes movie data and computes similarities.
- A **Streamlit-based frontend** for user interaction.
- **Heroku** deployment for easy access and demonstration.

## Features
- **Movie Search**: Select a movie from the database, and get 5 similar movies as recommendations.
- **Content-based Filtering**: The model recommends movies based on the content of the selected movie using cosine similarity.
- **Interactive UI**: A simple, intuitive interface built with Streamlit for easy user interaction.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Deployed on Heroku for easy access and scalability.

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend:
- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and computation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for vectorization (CountVectorizer) and calculating cosine distance.

### Frontend:
- **Streamlit**: Python framework for creating interactive web apps.

### Deployment:
- **Heroku**: Cloud platform for deployment.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used contains:
- Movie titles
- Genres
- Overviews
- Keywords

These features are used to compute similarities between movies.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ianjiteshan/MovieRecommender.git
cd movie-recommender-system
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the App Locally
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Usage
1. **Select a movie**: Use the dropdown in the Streamlit app to select a movie from the database.
2. **Get recommendations**: The app will display the top 5 movies most similar to your selection.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The movie dataset is loaded and processed. This includes extracting key features such as genres, keywords, and overviews.
   
2. **Vectorization**: 
   - We use **CountVectorizer** to convert the text-based features into vectors.
   
3. **Cosine Similarity**: 
   - **Cosine Similarity** is calculated between the vectorized movies to determine how close or similar they are to one another.
   
4. **Recommendations**: 
   - Based on the similarity scores, the app recommends the top 5 movies that are most similar to the movie selected by the user.

## Deployment

### Heroku Deployment Steps:
1. **Create Heroku App**: 
   - Log in to your Heroku account and create a new app.
   
2. **Add Buildpacks**:
   - Add `heroku/python` and `heroku-buildpack-apt`.

3. **Deploy the App**:
   - Push your code to Heroku:
     ```bash
     git push heroku main
     ```

4. **Access the App**:
   - The app will be accessible at the URL provided by Heroku.
